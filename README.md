# An Automated Web Vulnerability Scanner

Problem: Web Application vulnerabilities are the most common form of security vulnerability, composing 25% of all breaches. They are difficult to detect as they require specialized training to understand and most web applications have wide surface areas.

Solution: Create an automated web vulnerability scanner that will catch simple vulnerabilities to reduce the attack surface area of web applications.

Key Features: The application, at its simplest level, would function through being supplied a domain/url to a website. Additionally, subdomains and other endpoints may be specified. Our scanner would then execute a number of simple enumeration procedures commonly seen in pentesting (e.g. directory busting) and display the data to the user (e.g. Commonly named directories). The user can also supply additional information to be able to run more specialized scans (e.g. specify where user data may be reflected in the client to perform a Cross Site Scripting scan). 

Why This Project: Web application vulnerabilities, particularly client side ones, often affect not only the web applicationâ€™s provider but also the users. Many smaller web application providers also do not have the resources to contract audits of their applications. Because of this, the potential damage from and attack surface for web application vulnerabilities is extremely high. An automated scanner would hopefully be able to remediate at least the vulnerabilities that automated malicious vulnerability scanners check for.
